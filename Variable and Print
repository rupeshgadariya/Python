# 1. Write a python script containing a variable with some integer value, print value of
#    this variable.
x = 14
print(x)

# 2. Write a python script to print the value of a variable. Variable contains your name
#    as data.
x = "Rupesh kumar"
print(x)

# 3. Write a python script to print values of three variables, each in a new line. All
#    three variables are filled with some integer values.
x=5  # x,y,x = 5,"Rupesh kumar",90.41
y = "rupesh kumar"
z=96.33
print(x,y,z,sep='\n')

# 4. Create 5 variables each of them containing different types of data (like 35, True,
#    "MySirG", 5.46, 3+4j, etc). Write a python script to print values of all the 
#    variables along with their data types.
a,b,c,d,e = 35, True,"Rupesh kumar",5.14,4+5j,
print(a,type(a),b,type(b),c,type(c),d,type(d),e,type(e), sep='  ')

# 5. Create three variables and assign current date to them, first variable contains day
#    number, second variable contains month number and third variable contains year
#    number. Write a python script to display date in standard way (e.g. 29/11/2022)
d = 29 
m=11 
y=2022
print(d,m,y,sep='/')
